This directory contains a dump of the UCSC genome annotation database for the
    Dec. 2013 (GRCh38/hg38) assembly of the human genome
    (hg38, GRCh38 Genome Reference Consortium Human Reference 38 (GCA_000001405.15)) .

The annotations were generated by UCSC and collaborators worldwide.

For more information about this assembly, please note the NCBI resources:
    http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/51
    http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/assembly/883148
    http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/31257

Files included in this directory (updated nightly):

  - *.sql files:  the MySQL commands used to create the tables

  - *.txt.gz files: the database tables in a tab-delimited format
    compressed with gzip.

To see descriptions of the tables underlying Genome Browser annotation
tracks, select the table in the Table Browser:
  http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables?db=hg38
and click the "describe table schema" button.  There is also a "view
table schema" link on the configuration page for each track.

---------------------------------------------------------------
If you plan to download a large file or multiple files from this
directory, we recommend you use ftp rather than downloading the files
via our website. To do so, ftp to hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu, then go to
the directory goldenPath/hg38/database/. To download multiple
files, use the "mget" command:

    mget <filename1> <filename2> ...
    - or -
    mget -a (to download all the files in the directory)

Alternate methods to ftp access.

Using an rsync command to download the entire directory:
    rsync -avzP rsync://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg38/database/ .
For a single file, e.g. gc5BaseBw.txt.gz
    rsync -avzP 
        rsync://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg38/database/gc5BaseBw.txt.gz .

Or with wget, all files:
    wget --timestamping 
        'ftp://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg38/database/*'
With wget, a single file:
    wget --timestamping 
        'ftp://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg38/database/gc5BaseBw.txt.gz' 
        -O gc5BaseBw.txt.gz

Please note that some files contents, such as this example gc5BaseBw.txt.gz,
will point to the data being hosted in another /gbdb/ location, which
refers to ftp://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/gbdb/

To uncompress the *.txt.gz files:
    gunzip <table>.txt.gz
The tables can be loaded directly from the .txt.gz compressed file.
It is not necessary to uncompress them to load into a database,
as shown in the example below.

To load one of the tables directly into your local mirror database,
for example the table chromInfo:
## create table from the sql definition
$ hgsql hg38 < chromInfo.sql
## load data from the txt.gz file
$ zcat chromInfo.txt.gz | hgsql hg38 --local-infile=1 
        -e 'LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE "/dev/stdin" INTO TABLE chromInfo;'
